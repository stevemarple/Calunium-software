# Arduino Core for Calunium Arduino-clone

Calunium is an Arduino clone using the ATmega164A, ATmega164PA
ATmega324A, ATmega324PA, ATmega644A, ATmega644PA, ATmega1284 or
ATmega1284P microcontroller. The layout is designed for easy assembly
and maximum compatibility with the Arduino Uno, with additional
functionality being compatible with the Arduino Mega(2560).

This repository provides the Arduino software to support the Calunmium
boards.
